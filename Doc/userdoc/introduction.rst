FDO Toolbox is an application to view, manage and process spatial data. It is written in C# and uses the 
`Feature Data objects (FDO) <http://fdo.osgeo.org>`_ API. FDO Toolbox requires `.NET Framework 2.0 or above 
<http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/netframework/default.aspx>`_ to be installed.

FDO Toolbox is hosted on `Github <https://github.com/jumpinjackie/fdotoolbox>`_. You can download the latest 
binary releases and check out the latest source code using a `git <http://git-scm.com/>`_ client.

FDO Toolbox has been developed with extensibility in mind. It uses the `SharpDevelop Core <http://www.icsharpcode.net/OpenSource/SD/>`_ 
framework to provide an infrastructure for extensbility via Add-Ins. Add-Ins for FDO Toolbox are available to download from the 
`Add-In companion site <http://fdotoolbox-addins.googlecode.com>`_.
